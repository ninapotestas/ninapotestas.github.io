# SDR Receiver Project

This project involves developing a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver based on an FPGA platform with:

- RF front-end and filtering  
- Digital signal processing and demodulation  
- User interface powered by an ESP32 microcontroller

The design aims for a portable and flexible RF receiver for learning and experimentation.
