# Smartwatch Project

I am building a custom smartwatch using the ESP32 microcontroller, FreeRTOS, and a rotary encoder-based UI. The project covers:

- Hardware design with a round TFT display and sensors  
- Firmware development for sensor data acquisition and UI  
- Enclosure design ideas and assembly process
